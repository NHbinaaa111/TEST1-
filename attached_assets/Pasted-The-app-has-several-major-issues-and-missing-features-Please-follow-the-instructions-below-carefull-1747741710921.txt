The app has several major issues and missing features. Please follow the instructions below carefully and fix each point thoroughly:


---

1. Study Recommendations:

Issue A: When there is no data, the placeholders are unhelpful and misleading (e.g., "You haven't studied Chemistry in 387 days").

Replace with friendly fallback text like:

> “No study data available yet. Complete Pomodoro sessions or log test scores to see personalized recommendations.”




Issue B: Recommendations don’t update unless the full site is refreshed.

Fix the refresh button in the recommendations section so it fetches fresh data without a full page reload.


Issue C: The Dashboard only shows one subject or incorrect data.

Ensure recommendations are shown for all 3 subjects (Physics, Chemistry, Math) on both the main Dashboard and JEE Dashboard.

Keep the data in sync between both dashboards.




---

2. Pomodoro Timer Bugs:

Prevent any Pomodoro settings (duration, subject) from being changed while the timer is running.

Disable input fields & subject selector once a session has started.


Fix the bug where the subject resets back to “General Study” when the session is edited mid-run.

Preserve the selected subject during the full Pomodoro cycle.




---

3. Pomodoro → Study Sessions Integration:

After completing a Pomodoro session, automatically log it as a new study session.

Include:

Subject (P/C/M)

Duration

Title (optional or default: "Pomodoro Session")





---

4. Study Sessions:

Add a subject selector (Physics, Chemistry, Math) when logging or editing study sessions.

Add an edit option to:

Change title

Change subject

Decrease time (but not increase beyond original duration)


Add clean UI feedback after saving an edit (toast/snackbar confirmation).



---

5. Graph + Analytics Fixes:

The current line/bar graphs are too confusing.

Use simpler, cleaner charts with proper legends and consistent colors per subject.

Label axes and data points clearly.

Use line charts or pie charts only if they are easy to understand at a glance.




---

6. UI/UX & Visual Theme Overhaul:

The site’s visuals are inconsistent:

Random white borders

Sudden black sections that break the dark theme


Redesign the entire site to maintain a cohesive dark + neon aesthetic, including:

Unified card styles

Rounded corners (2xl)

Neon borders or shadows

Consistent text & icon colors


Ensure responsive design:

Fix text overlaps on mobile

Make all components adjust gracefully on smaller screens

Test mobile view for every main page

Once done, please list exactly what you’ve changed, and ensure NO placeholder content is left behind. This is a high-priority production fix — so the site should be completely usable, intuitive, and bug-free after this update
